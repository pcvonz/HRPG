# HRPG
A habit client rpg made with the Godot engine. Because why not!

Instructions:

Create a folder in the root directory called **key.txt**. The contents should contain your user_id and then your api key. Like so:

```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You will also need an ssl certificate. The Godot wiki has a tutorial on that [here](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/wiki/tutorial_ssl).
